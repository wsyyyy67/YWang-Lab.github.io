# Research in the Wang Lab

---
Defining novel therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of death worldwide, has long been a key area in my own work. By integrating the state-of-art technologies including super-resolution microscopy, single-molecule pulldown (SiM-pull), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) Microscopy (FRET), diverse animal models (myocardial infarction) induced ischemic heart model, high-fat-diet-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy model ,and chronic β-adrenergic stimulation induced heart failure model), and transgenic
mice, I have provided multiple promising molecular targets for rescuing cardiac dysfunction targeting local adrenergic signaling at nanodomains and contributed to the successful translation of a drug candidate, SCM-198 from bench to bedside.

### Research Topic 1

Cardiac contraction is orchestrated by compartmentalization of β-adrenergic signaling at distinct subcellular nanodomains. The highly organized architecture in cardiomyocytes provides spatial context for the subcellular localized cAMP/PKA signaling in the regulation of sophisticated EC-coupling, a process of heart to contract and relax. To visualize the cAMP/PKA nano-domains, we have developed a serial of genetical encoded Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors anchoring at the distinct subcellular locations including
plasma membrane (PM), sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), myofilament (MF), and nuclear envelop. By collaborating with the world-leading
experts, Prof. Donald M. Bers and Prof. Johannes W Hell and utilizing these powerful tools as well as the cutting-edge technologies, super-resolution imaging, proximity ligation assay (PLA, Figure 2), and singlemolecule pulldown (SIM), I discovered a pool of
intracellular β-adrenergic receptors (βAR) at the SR is essential for PKA-phosphorylation of phospholamban and cardiac contractility (Wang et al 2021a Circulation Research).

### Research Topic 2
Desensitization of β1AR signaling and depressed cardiac contractility are hallmarks of heart failure (HF). Therefore, we asked whether the SR-localized β1ARs are engaged in the HF. Using the HFrEF (HF with reduced ejection fraction) model induced by chronic adrenergic stimulation and an ischemic HF model induced by myocardial infarction, I found the elevation of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) desensitized
intracellular β1ARs signaling in HF (Wang et al 2021b Circulation Research). Knockout or inhibition of MAO-A resensitizes intracellular β1AR signaling and inotropic responsiveness in failing mice (Wang, Circulation, Under review). My investigation of MAO-A-mediated intracellular β1AR/PKA signal cascade was granted by the prestigious
American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship.

### Research Topic 3


Membrane Attack Complex (MAC)/perforin family proteins represent an important ans conserved pore-forming proteins involved in immunity and defense. They form giant pores on membrane, following a dramatic transition between prepore to pore. We have determined several key structures by X-ray crystallography and cryoEM, cryoET subtomogram averaging (Ni et al 2018, Science Advances, Ni et al 2020, Science Advances).

We are continuing to solve the puzzle of pore-forming proteins, focusing on perforin-2. More interesting story is comming soon...

### Research Topic 4

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2" style="margin-top: 0px;">

Cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) has gained increasing importance to study molecular architectures of viruses, bacteria and cellular components in situ. It can provide structures of macromolecular complexes in situ and in cellular context at or below subnanometer resolution. Combined with cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling for sample preparation this has led to unprecedented insights into the inner working of molecular machines in their native environment, as well as their functional relevant conformations and spatial distribution within biological cells or tissues. Despite its rapid development in recent years, many hardware and software are still evolving to address the increasing challenges due to the complexity of biological systems.

We are looking for candidates with strong interest in data processing and software development. The specific projects will be determined together with PI and student and potential directions include but not limit to:

* Development of hardware and software for automated high-throughput cryoET data collection and pre-processing;  
* Method development for cryoET data analysis and subtomogram averaging, such as using Artificial Intelligence (AI) based approach for target recognition;  
* Methods development and optimization for cryogenic correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM).
